# nagios-external-commands

## Overview

This is a series of HTML pages arranged to allow you to browse all the Nagios 
External Commands, which can be used to control Nagios through scripting.

The original set of these commands were found on an old Nagios website. They 
were downloaded and reformatted into something a little easier on the eyes.

This set of information is still publically available on the internet, but 
very hard to find, so I put it here so it can be more easily found, and in 
a better format than the original.
